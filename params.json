First user group has no SSH access, and second group has only chrooted SFTP access.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running LPI\r\n\r\nTo run LPI, first, check the required repositories are enabled (precise-updates/multiverse and precise/multiverse).\r\n\r\nEdit: /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment as required, then run apt-get update\r\n\r\nTo run LPI, simply execute the .sh script as sudo or root.\r\n\r\n### Usage options\r\n\r\nUsage: ./lpi-core.sh [options...]\r\n\r\n- -a             Install all. Same as -m -p -w -o curl,unzip,rsync\r\n- -r             Set DotDeb repo for php5.4.\r\n- -p             Install php5-fpm\r\n- -w             Install Apache2\r\n- -o [ progs ]   Install extra packages like curl or unzip delimited with \",\"\r\n- -m             Install mysql server\r\n- -s PrimaryGroup,SecondaryGroup\r\n- -d             Enable debug logging.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n- LPI currently only works on Ubuntu 12.04+ LTS\r\n- LPI cannot uninstall, reinstall or upgrade packages.  If existing packages or files are to be overwritten, LPI will stop with an error\r\n- LPI assumes chroot directory is /home/chroot.  You can change CHROOT variable as required\r\n\r\n### No Guarantees\r\n\r\nLPI comes with no guarantees.  Use at your own risk\r\n","google":"UA-46210494-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
